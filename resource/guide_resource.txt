create paste to all patterns from image
remember... all name paste in lower casa

this example is >>>

    BACKGROUND // I'm not going to use background-image, but here's the idea
               // I will be using only solid or transparent colors, generated by the script itself
               // The script then creates a layer for us
    HAIR-IN-BACKGROUND
        FACE
        
        BUSHES
        SKINMARK

        NOISE
        MOUTH        
        EYEBROW
        EYES
    HAIR-IN-FACE

    UPPER-HEAD

remember, file names must have a .png extension and same name as folder from.
                     and the caracter '_' is not allowed, so use '-' instead
                     the `_` is used to logic and set values to atributes
the scripts go look for it like this: /resources/face/face{asc.id and attr}.png

Attributes for script compression are in the filename, so be careful when entering file names

//this atributes has obrigatory
attributes:
    id = {part_name}{any int number} // referent to patterns family
    color = _color{any int number} // color of patterns, this is attr which is used to 
                                      differentiate the files

//optional attributes
rarity attributes:
    rare (50%) : _r
    very rare (20%) : _v
    epic (10%) : _e
    legendary (5%) : _l
    mythic (1%) : _m

//this this rarity will still be more specific, because in the end it will still be 
  fitted with common files and other different rarities...

//that is, it will enter a calculation worth 50, while all the others are worth 100.

//that is, this number does not fully represent the rarity, 
  it can and should change in the execution of the script

//example
    possibility parts = [ common, rare ]
                           100     50

    final rarity      = [ common, rare ]
                           75      25
